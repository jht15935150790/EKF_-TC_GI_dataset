# EKF_-TC_GI_dataset

Project Authors: Haitao Jiang


This dataset has following features:

1.More light-weight and easy for downloading.

2.The raw GNSS data were acquired using a u-blox F9P board operating at a sampling rate of 10 Hz, while the raw IMU data was obtained through the MYNTEYE-s1030 module. 
The reference trajectory was computed using the post-processing kinematic mode of NovAtel Inertial Explorer software, utilizing the tactical-grade GNSS/INS POS320 system
